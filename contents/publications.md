This paper investigates equilibria selection and price dynamics in a complex OLG economy with multiple perfect-foresight equilibria using learning-to-forecast and learning-to-optimize experiments. In the theoretical model, these dynamics depend on one utility function parameter. We conduct five treatments to test price convergence and coordination with different values of this parameter corresponding to (i) a stable 2-cycle, (ii) a stable 3-cycle, (iii) a stable 4-cycle, and (iv) chaos. This paper highlights three key findings: First, price converges to the simplest equilibria (steady state and 2-cycle) in all groups of the learning-to-forecast experiment. Second, convergence to the 2-cycle occurs for the intermediate parameter range, while theoretical scenarios of 2-cycle and highly nonlinear dynamics (chaos) lead to coordination on the steady state in the lab. Finally, convergence in the learning-to-optimize experiment is harder to achieve, and the 2-cycle is not observed although it Pareto dominates the steady state in terms of payoff.

- *<strong><strong>The Passthrough from Inflation Perceptions to Inflation Expectations</strong></strong>, Stefanie Huber, Daria Minina and Tobias Schmidt (2023).[<i> submitted </i>]* [[Deutsche Bundesbank Discussion Paper]](https://www.bundesbank.de/resource/blob/902668/365682610f6c37a512c5905f66f8f285/mL/2023-06-30-dkp-17-data.pdf)

After decades of stable prices, central bankers face the crucial challenge of keeping inflation and inflation expectations contained. We show a strong relationship between households’ perceptions about average inflation over the past 12 months and households’ short- and long-term expectations about future inflation. The strength of this pass-through from perceptions to expectations varies across socioeconomic groups. We find two key moderating factors for this heterogeneity: differential information sources used to form inflation perceptions and differences in individual uncertainty about future inflation. We find that when assessing average inflation over the last 12 months the large majority of households report reliance upon their own shopping experience rather than information they have heard or read. Our results suggest that in seeking to manage inflation expectations, central bankers could beneficially spend further effort in managing inflation perceptions. Our results have important policy implications. Central banks can influence inflation expectations directly and indirectly by influencing perceptions.
