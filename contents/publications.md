This paper investigates equilibria selection and price dynamics in a complex OLG economy with multiple perfect-foresight equilibria using learning-to-forecast and learning-to-optimize experiments. In the theoretical model, these dynamics depend on one utility function parameter. We conduct five treatments to test price convergence and coordination with different values of this parameter corresponding to (i) a stable 2-cycle, (ii) a stable 3-cycle, (iii) a stable 4-cycle, and (iv) chaos. This paper highlights three key findings: First, price converges to the simplest equilibria (steady state and 2-cycle) in all groups of the learning-to-forecast experiment. Second, convergence to the 2-cycle occurs for the intermediate parameter range, while theoretical scenarios of 2-cycle and highly nonlinear dynamics (chaos) lead to coordination on the steady state in the lab. Finally, convergence in the learning-to-optimize experiment is harder to achieve, and the 2-cycle is not observed although it Pareto dominates the steady state in terms of payoff.

- *<strong><strong>The Passthrough from Inflation Perceptions to Inflation Expectations</strong></strong>, Stefanie Huber, Daria Minina and Tobias Schmidt (2023).[<i> submitted </i>]* [[Deutsche Bundesbank Discussion Paper]](https://www.bundesbank.de/resource/blob/902668/365682610f6c37a512c5905f66f8f285/mL/2023-06-30-dkp-17-data.pdf)

After decades of stable prices, central bankers face the crucial challenge of keeping inflation and inflation expectations contained. We show a strong relationship between households’ perceptions about average inflation over the past 12 months and households’ short- and long-term expectations about future inflation. The strength of this pass-through from perceptions to expectations varies across socioeconomic groups. We find two key moderating factors for this heterogeneity: differential information sources used to form inflation perceptions and differences in individual uncertainty about future inflation. We find that when assessing average inflation over the last 12 months the large majority of households report reliance upon their own shopping experience rather than information they have heard or read. Our results suggest that in seeking to manage inflation expectations, central bankers could beneficially spend further effort in managing inflation perceptions. Our results have important policy implications. Central banks can influence inflation expectations directly and indirectly by influencing perceptions.

- *<strong><strong>House Prices and Rents as Signals for Consumer Inflation Expectations</strong></strong>, Gabriele Galati, Daria Minina, Richhild Moessner, and Maarten van Rooij.*
  
Using the data from a representative consumer survey, this paper documents a robust empirical fact that homeowners expect higher inflation on all time horizons than renters. I then explore the potential reasons for this finding. I identify the perceived inflation as the main reason for the observed gap in inflation expectations. Homeowners and renters differ in their estimates of current inflation which results in the differences in expectations. House prices and rents, in turn, play an important role in the formation of inflation perceptions. The findings of the paper suggest that informing consumers about the current level of inflation might be an effective monetary policy tool.  

- *<strong><strong>The effect of information on consumer inflation expectations</strong></strong>, Daria Minina, Gabriele Galati, Richhild Moessner and Maarten van Rooij.*

This paper examines how information provision affects consumers’ inflation expectations. Using data from a representative Dutch household survey, we document that providing information about current and past inflation rates, as well as the ECB inflation target, brings inflation expectations closer to the target and reduces the upward bias typically found in the literature. The beneficial effect of information holds across various types of inflation expectations and time horizons. We also find that consumers' reactions to information are heterogeneous, with women, individuals with low levels of education and income, and renters showing stronger reactions to information provision. Finally, we observe that the effect of information provision on inflation expectations in times of normal economic activity is similar to its effects during periods of large economic shocks such the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Ukraine war and the start in 2022 of the monetary tightening cycle following a strong increase in inflation.

- *<strong><strong>The Effects of Macro and Micro Shocks on the Firms' Price-Setting. The Expectations Channel</strong></strong>.*

I study how firms' price-setting decisions react to macro and micro shocks using a representative survey. I split a shock that an economy faces into two orthogonal components, a micro shock that affects only firms' own performance and a macro shock that affects the general economic conditions and other firms. The paper analyzes the effect of both shock components using one adverse event that firms in Germany faced over the period from 2020 until 2023, the war in Ukraine. I identify the firms that suffered only a macro shock after this event and the enterprises that faced both macro and micro shocks. The paper's first important takeaway is that firms' expectations react differently depending on whether they face a micro or a macro shock. Aggregate expectations change more after a purely macro shock, while individual expectations adjust more after a micro shock. The macro and micro shocks also feed differently into the price-setting decisions. A purely macro war shock is associated with a larger price increase, while the firms that face a combined shock adjust prices less. These findings are in line with costly information acquisition and rational inattention literature, and they hint that providing information about current general economic conditions to firms might be beneficial.
