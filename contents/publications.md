This paper investigates equilibria selection and price dynamics in a complex OLG economy with multiple perfect-foresight equilibria using learning-to-forecast and learning-to-optimize experiments. In the theoretical model, these dynamics depend on one utility function parameter. We
conduct five treatments to test price convergence and coordination with different values of this parameter corresponding to (i) a stable 2-cycle, (ii) a stable 3-cycle, (iii) a stable 4-cycle, and (iv)
chaos. This paper highlights three key findings: First, price converges to the simplest equilibria (steady state and 2-cycle) in all groups of the learning-to-forecast experiment. Second, convergence to the 2-cycle occurs for the intermediate parameter range, while theoretical scenarios of
2-cycle and highly nonlinear dynamics (chaos) lead to coordination on the steady state in the lab. Finally, convergence in the learning-to-optimize experiment is harder to achieve, and the 2-cycle is not observed although it Pareto dominates the steady state in terms of payoff.
